description: Class ZCL_ODATA_MAIN
---

This abstract class is the blueprint for every entity class used by this framework.

## [/IWBEP/IF_MGW_APPL_SRV_RUNTIME](/dev-objects/sap-objects/iwbep-if_mgw_appl_srv_runtime)

Every method of the "/iwbep/if_mgw_appl_srv_runtime" interface can be redefined in the sub class. Only the methods that you really need have to be redefined.

## Calling other Methods of the DPC_EXT Class

For calling other methods of the dpc_ext class you can use the protected attribute "DPC_OBJECT". It holds the instance of the dpc_ext class.

## Methods

### BEFORE_PROCESSING

This method can be used and redefined. Â Just add this method before calling the entity class.
Here you can add some logic that should be executed before calling the odata methods.

### RAISE_ERROR

This method can be used to convert own exception classes into exceptions that can be handled in the UI with the "message manager".

### COPY_DATA_TO_REF

This method uses the standard odata "copy_data_to_ref" method. But adds a custom returning header with the maximal count.

### GET_REQUEST_HEADER

Reads out the header attributes of the request.

### ENTITYSET_FILTER_PAGE_ORDER

This method applies dynamic filtering, pagination and sorting to the current entity set table. This is ment to be called after selecting the entries.

> [!attention]
> This can be heavily non performant. If you can, please filter and paginate your entries before or while selecting.
> This is a lazy option without caring about performance.

The options can also be called separate.

- [PAGINATE_COLLECTION](#PAGINATE_COLLECTION)
- [FILTER_COLLECTION](#FILTER_COLLECTION)

### PAGINATE_COLLECTION
